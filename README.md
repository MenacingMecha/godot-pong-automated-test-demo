# Pong with Automated Testing Demo

Demo project integrating automated tests with GUT into a template project, developed as part of a series of feasibility tests for my honours project.

Very basic GUT functionality used just to show feasibility - could easily be improved with stubs and parameterized tests.

Originally based on the [official Pong with GDScript Demo](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/121)
